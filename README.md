# Pastel Calculator

This is a calculator project that I've done as part of "The Odin Project"s Foundations curriculum. I have learned quite a lot from this project, including how callback functions should be called. I also improved on the readability and cleanliness of my code and paid attention to separation of concerns.

## Features

- Add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers.
- Operate with floating-point numbers using the decimal button.
- See up to 3 decimals after calculation.
- Clean, minimal design with no sharp contrast between the colors to prevent eye fatigue.
